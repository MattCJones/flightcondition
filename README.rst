About
=====

Airspeed conversions (true/calibrated/equivalent/Mach), atmospheric data, and
more with built-in unit checking.  Specific sub-modules include:

* :code:`flightcondition` : input altitude to compute common flight condition data.  Easily swap between Mach number, true airspeed, calibrated airspeed, and equivalent airspeed.  Includes atmospheric data.
* :code:`atmosphere` : input altitude to compute 1993 International Standard Atmosphere data.  Many relevant, derived quantities are included.
* :code:`units` : built-in unit-checking and conversion using `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_ package.

See examples below for usage!.

Installation
============

Install Commands
----------------

Install using the :code:`pip` package-management system.  The easiest method is
to open the terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flightcondition

Alternatively, manually download the `source code
<https://github.com/MattCJones/flightcondition>`_, unpack, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install <path/to/flightcondition>

Dependencies
------------

* `numpy <https://numpy.org>`_: package for scientific computing.

* `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_: package for dealing with units.

Usage
=====
In a Python script or an ipython notebook, import all utilities with,

.. code-block:: python

    from flightcondition import *

or more explicitly as shown in the following examples.


Flight Condition
----------------

The :code:`Flightcondition` class can be used to compute and interact with
common flight condition data.

Outputs include:

* Mach number :code:`mach`
* True airspeed :code:`TAS`
* Calibrated airspeed :code:`CAS`
* Equivalent airspeed :code:`EAS`
* Dynamic pressure :code:`q_inf`
* Reynolds number :code:`reynolds_number(ell)`
* Reynolds number per-unit-length :code:`reynolds_number_per_unit_length(length_unit)`
* Atmosphere data :code:`atm` (see :code:`atmosphere` below) 

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from flightcondition import FlightCondition, unit, dimless

    # Compute flight conditions for a scalar or array of altitudes
    altitudes = [0, 10e3, 33.5e3] * unit('ft')
    fc = FlightCondition(altitudes, EAS=300*unit('knots'))

    # Print flight condition data:
    print(f"{fc}")

    # Print extended output in Imperial units:
    print(f"\n{fc.tostring(full_output=True, imperial_units=True)}")

    # Access flight speed formats individually
    M_inf, U_inf, U_CAS, U_EAS = fc.mach, fc.TAS, fc.CAS, fc.EAS

    # Access atmospheric data alone (see Atmosphere class for options)
    atm = fc.atm  # access Atmosphere object 'atm'
    p, T, rho, nu, a = atm.p, atm.T, atm.rho, atm.nu, atm.a

    # Input true/calibrated/equivalent airspeed or Mach number
    fc_TAS = FlightCondition(altitudes, TAS=300*unit('knots'))
    fc_CAS = FlightCondition(altitudes, CAS=300*unit('knots'))
    fc_EAS = FlightCondition(altitudes, EAS=300*unit('knots'))
    fc_mach = FlightCondition(altitudes, mach=0.4535*dimless)

    # Specify desired units on input and output
    altitudes_in_km = [0, 3.048, 10.2108] * unit('km')
    fc_other_units = FlightCondition(altitudes, EAS=154.33*unit('m/s'))
    U_TAS = fc_other_units.TAS
    print(f"\nThe true airspeed in m/s is {U_TAS.to('m/s'):.5g}")
    print(f"The true airspeed in km/s is {U_TAS.to('km/s'):.5g}")

    # Compute additional derived quantities (see class for all options)
    print(f"\nThe dynamic pressure in psi is {fc.q_inf.to('psi'):.5g}")
    ell = 60 * unit('in')  # arbitrary length scale of interest
    print(f"The Reynolds number is {fc.reynolds_number(ell):.5g}")
    print(f"The Reynolds number per-unit-length [1/in] is "
        f"{fc.reynolds_number_per_unit_length('in'):.5g}")

Atmosphere
----------

The :code:`Atmosphere` class can be used to compute and interact with common
standard atmosphere data and derived quantities.

Outputs include:

* Pressure :code:`p`
* Temperature :code:`T`
* Density :code:`rho`
* Sound speed :code:`a`
* Dynamic viscosity :code:`mu`
* Kinematic viscosity :code:`nu`
* Thermal conductivity :code:`k`
* Layer name :code:`layer.name`
* Geometric altitude :code:`h`
* Geopotential altitude :code:`H`
* Acceleration due to gravity :code:`g`
* Mean free path :code:`mean_free_path`

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from flightcondition import Atmosphere, unit

    # Compute atmospheric data for a scalar or array of altitudes
    h = [0.0, 12.7, 44.2, 81.0] * unit('km')
    atm = Atmosphere(h)

    # Print abbreviated output:
    print(f"\n{atm}")

    # Print extended output in Imperial units:
    print(f"\n{atm.tostring(full_output=True, imperial_units=True)}")

    # See also the linspace() function from numpy, e.g.
    # h = linspace(0, 81.0, 82) * unit('km')

    # Access individual properties and convert to desired units: "
    p, T, rho, nu, a = atm.p, atm.T, atm.rho, atm.nu, atm.a
    print(f"\nThe pressure in psi is {p.to('psi'):.5g}")

    # Compute additional properties such as thermal conductivity,
    # mean free path, and more (see class for all options)
    print(f"\nThe thermal conductivity is {atm.k:.5g}"
        f"\nThe mean free path = {atm.mean_free_path:.5g}")

Units
-----

Conveniently input, output, and convert units using `pint
<https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_ units.

.. code-block:: python

    from flightcondition import unit, printv

    h = 33 * unit('km')
    print(h.to('kft'))
    # >>> 108.26771653543307 kft
    printv(h, to='kft')
    # >>> h = 108.27 kft

    U_inf = 20 * unit('knots')
    rho_inf = 1.225 * unit('kg/m^3')
    q_inf = 0.5*rho_inf*U_inf**2
    printv(q_inf, to='psi')
    # >>> q_inf = 0.0094042 psi

Note that `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_ does not support conflicting
unit registries so avoid interactions between :code:`flightcondition.unit` and
a separate :code:`pint.UnitRegistry`.
